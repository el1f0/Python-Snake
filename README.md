The game was made to work in Visual Studio Code, and isn't guaranteed to work in other IDE's. 

To play, download the repository and open the folder in your editor (IMPORTANT). 

Then, press run and a game menu should pop up. If it doesn't you might have opened the wrong folder or might have to change the directory for the sound effects and music, to do this simply change the sound_path to where the files are on your specific system.

If you are getting errors you might also have to install some of the Python modules that the program uses. To do this, simmply write pip install {module name} and it should install.
